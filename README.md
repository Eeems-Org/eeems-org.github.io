# https://remarkable.guide
A guide for hacking your reMarkable tablet.

### Can I make changes?
Pull Requests and Issues are welcome! The site is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and images are generated with
[TikZ](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package).

### How do I build the site?
You will need the following installed:
- build-essential
- graphviz
- libgraphviz-dev
- librsvg2-bin
- pdf2svg
- pipenv
- python
- texlive-base
- texlive-latex-extra

At which point in time you can build the site with `make`.

If you would like to have the site automatically update as you change files in [src](src), you can run `make dev`. This will open the build
of the site in your browser, and auto update the page when you make changes. If you would like to automatically update
[src/_static/images](src/_static/images) as you make changes to [images](images), you cna run `make dev-images`.

### How do I add a page to the site?
Create a new `*.rst` file in [src](src).

### How do I add a link to a page to the sidebar?
Add it's name to [src/sitemap.rst](src/sitemap.rst).

### How do I add a picture to the site?
Adding an image to the site can be done by adding a `*.png.tex` or `*.svg.tex` file in [images](images), or adding the image itself to
[src/_static](src/_static). Please don't add them directly to [src/_static/images](src/_static/images) as this will be replaced
by images generated by [images](images) as part of the build process.
