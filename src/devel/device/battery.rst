Battery
=======

As this is a standard linux system, you can find the battery interface in the ``/sys/class/power_supply`` directory. This will contain a standard `power supply class <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/power_supply_class.html>`_ that you can read battery information from.
