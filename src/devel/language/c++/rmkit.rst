rmKit Framework
===============

rmKit is a header only library for building applications.

Pros
====

- Simple UI and input handling.
- Includes a simulator to speed up application development.
- No external dependencies.

Cons
====

- Since this is a header only library, every application that uses it must be recompiled with the latest header to get the latest bug fixes.
- Since this is a header only library, it will be extremely difficult to use in languages other than C++.
